### problem
##  when product is added in store , how do we get to know , is there any signal or 
## do we periodically check for new product (this can be done by count all product each time and if there is any increment we store that)
---> periodically (tougf though)

 if  product is added only we can easily do by count, but what if we delete , update , the product ?? 
 first way fetch each product and check with the id , and update each time with the latest (as how to know it is updated)

 other way fetch all product , store them and delete old one (stored ) (easy way ) 

trying to implement this

## now to trigger that url every day , use celery 


## restore product ,
I have json field - it either have 1 product detail or multiple product details , 
so first i fetch the json data related to that id , then run a for loop to update all  product as by put 

-- succesfully implement this and if a product is not exist create that , but there is issue with image (no image disply)

*** jab product nhi hoga tab , create kr rahai hai product jisse id change ho rhi hai ** 

** Try backuping all objects with single endpoints , 
and restore them too

// order 
Orders-analysis

we have 
1.Re-open a closed order  ,, if we open a order  and old version is open then can use this 
,Close an order         if open  order then can close that  again 

?? can we delete order (yes)
--- if the order is deleted then create it

update how to change selected product ?? 
*Cancels an order. Orders that are paid and have fulfillments can't be canceled.

The GET orders endpoint returns open orders by default.


update ** This operation allows for updating properties of an order including `buyer_accepts_marketing`, `email`, `phone`, `note`, `tags`, `metafields` and `shipping_address_attributes`. It is not for editing the items of an order.



what are metafields ?? here
